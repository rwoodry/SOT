# SOT
Scripts for running the Spatial Orientation Task on Unity WebGL. Will be hosted alongside spatialneuroscience.bio.uci.edu/OFT, meant for online use with our MTurk project.

These Scripts are used in the Unity WebGL build version of the Spatial Orientation Task developed at the Hegarty LAb at UC Santa Barbara. We have adapted their task for online use at UC Irvine.

The 5 minute task can be taken by clicking on the link below.
